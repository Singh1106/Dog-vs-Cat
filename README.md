# Dog-vs-Cat in pytorch
Differentiating between a dog and a cat.

Dog vs cat GPU is the FNN i made with very limited hidden layers, i got 3 hidden layers, it is basically bruteforcing right now, i am new at this, so the accuracy is around 50%, which is basically nothing !

Dog vs cat resnet is the NN in which i used transfer learning, i used the pretrained resnet 18 and changed the last layer to use it in my NN, its much faster and the accuracy is around 99% but you can see in my last layer which i trained, it is definately showing over fitting but that's just one small layer out of whole resnet 18, rest of the NN is properly trained.
